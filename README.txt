collective.recaptcha
====================

This package provides an integration of the Recaptcha service into Zope.
Recaptcha is a third-party CAPTCHA service provided by Carnegie Mellon
University.  One of its most interesting features is that the act of
users answering CAPTCHAs contributes to efforts to digitize books.

The API is based on collective.captcha and is provided via a "@@captcha"
browser view, so these two packages can be swapped for each other relatively
simply.  Use collective.captcha if you need to not be dependent on an external
service; use collective.recaptcha for a slightly better user experience.


Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

Simply make sure that the ZCML for this package is loaded.  (You cannot configure
this package at the same time as collective.captcha, because the '@@captcha'
browser view registration will conflict.)

Before the service will work, you must obtain a public and private key from
http://recaptcha.net, and configure them at http://path/to/site/@@recaptcha-settings


Usage
-----

You can insert a Recaptcha using the following TAL::

  <tal:block tal:replace="structure context/@@captcha/image_tag"/>

You can verify Recaptcha input by testing the return value of::

  context.restrictedTraverse('@@captcha').verify()


Differences between this package's API and collective.captcha
-------------------------------------------------------------

Because the simplest form of Recaptcha is rendered entirely via a remote call
to the service, we couldn't implement the ICaptchaView interface from
collective.captcha exactly as it was defined there.  Differences include::

  * The image_tag method returns the HTML for the entire CAPTCHA widget,
    including text entry and audio link, not just the tag for the CAPTCHA
    image.

  * The audio_url method returns None
  
  * The verify method does not require the input parameter, as a standard
    form input name is used and the value can be found in the request.

  * There is an additional method, external, which simply returns True.
    This is a bit of a hack so that a template requiring captcha can
    adjust to the different semantics of the @@captcha view in this
    package as compared to collective.captcha.
