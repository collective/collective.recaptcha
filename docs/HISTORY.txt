Changelog
=========

1.1.1 (2011-02-15)
------------------

* Register the @@captcha view using browser:page instead of browser:view,
  because I still fail to understand the latter and was breaking access from
  restricted python in Zope 2.12.
  [davisagli]

1.1 (2010-11-18)
----------------

* Use the recaptcha settings from plone.formwidget.recaptcha if it is
  installed, since it overrides our recaptcha-settings view.
  [davisagli]

1.0.1 (2009-08-05)
------------------

* Disallowed dependency on broken release of recaptcha-client (1.0.4).
  [davisagli]


1.0 (2009-05-04)
----------------

* Fixed method signature for verify method so that the vestigial input parameter
  from collective.captcha's ICaptchaView is no longer required.
  [davisagli]

* Added documentation.
  [davisagli]


1.0b2 (2009-01-14)
------------------

* Correctly handle comma-delimited values in the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR
  header.
  [davisagli]

* Added support for verifying the captcha multiple times within the same request.
  [davisagli]

* Added security declarations on the view methods so they can be called from
  restricted Python.
  [davisagli]

------------------

* Initial release
